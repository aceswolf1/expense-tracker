# expense-tracker
This is my first attemp to create a expenses tracker.

# Main Information

I used this project to practice Vanilla JS which includes:
  - Functions
  - Classes
  - Methods
  - Closure
  - Object manipulation

The application uses a <<gastos.js>> as an object that works as a database.
This aplication is in Spanish, also all of its functions.
